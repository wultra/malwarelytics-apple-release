## Swift Package Manager

Add the following repository as a dependency into your project:
   ```
   https://github.com/wultra/malwarelytics-apple-release
   ```
   
   You can use Xcode's dedicated user interface to do this or add the dependency manually, for example:
   
   ```swift
   // swift-tools-version:5.4

   import PackageDescription

   let package = Package(
       name: "YourLibrary",
       products: [
           .library(
               name: "YourLibrary",
               targets: ["YourLibrary"]),
       ],
       dependencies: [
           .package(name: "AppProtection", url: "https://github.com/wultra/malwarelytics-apple-release.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "1.1.0"))
       ],
       targets: [
           .target(
               name: "YourLibrary",
               dependencies: [
                   "AppProtection"
               ])
       ]
   )
   ```
   
You can check the latest versions of the library at the [release page](https://github.com/wultra/malwarelytics-apple-release/tags).

   target 'MyProject' do
       use_frameworks!
       pod 'AppProtection', :git => 'https://github.com/wultra/malwarelytics-apple-release.git', :tag => '1.1.0'
   end
   ```
