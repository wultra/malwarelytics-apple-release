# User Screenshot Detection

User screenshots can leak sensitive information from an application. For this reason, it's important to try to avoid it if possible. Unfortunately, on iOS it's not possible to block screenshots, the application can only detect that a screenshot was taken and possibly inform the user that it's necessary to be careful with sensitive data.

Malwarelytics for Apple is able to detect that a screenshot was taken and notify the app about it.

## Configuration

There's no configuration for the feature.

## Usage 

After service creation, the user screenshot detection feature can be accessed via `AppProtectionRasp`. This can be used to add a delegate.

### Observing Detection

The user screenshot detection can trigger a certain action. To achieve that, a delegate needs to be added.

Delegate configuration:

```swift
class RaspDelegate: AppProtectionRaspDelegate {

    // other delegate code

    func userScreenshotDetected() {
        // handle user screenshot detection
    }
}
```

The delegate can be added in `AppProtectionRasp`. When it is no longer needed, it can be removed again.

```swift
let raspDelegate = RaspDelegate()
appProtection.rasp.addDelegate(raspDelegate)
appProtection.rasp.removeDelegate(raspDelegate)
```
